# IMU-Algorithm
IMU is Inertial measurement unit. I have finished and implemented an algorithm that can effectively calculate IMU sensors gesture angle: yaw, pitch, row.<br>
The video is a test case of my algorithm, the man holds an IMU sensor in his right hand and controls the characters in the game.

The work has been transformed to product and patent has been applied , so related code can't be publical. My work is the software part of the handler. <br>
I welcome the communitcation on IMU's Gesture algorithm, please contact me at gouxute@yahoo.co.jp
